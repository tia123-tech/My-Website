    <h1>Camp Awaits...</h1>
    <p>
        You‚Äôve been called. Your journey begins now.
        The mist is thick. The signs are unclear. But one thing is certain:
        you‚Äôre not just a regular mortal.The gods are at war. The world is on the brink of destruction. And only seven demigods‚Äîplus a few unexpected allies‚Äîcan
        stop the rise of Gaea, the primordial Earth goddess. The Prophecy of Seven foretells their journey: "Seven half-bloods
        shall answer the call, To storm or fire, the world must fall. An oath to keep with a final breath, And foes bear arms to
        the Doors of Death."<br> From Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter, two groups of demigods‚ÄîGreek and Roman‚Äîmust set aside
        their centuries-old rivalry to unite against a common enemy. Percy Jackson, son of Poseidon, and Annabeth Chase,
        daughter of Athena, are thrown into a battle bigger than any they‚Äôve faced. Alongside them are the Roman praetor Jason
        Grace, daughter-of-Aphrodite-turned-warrior Piper McLean, and the fiery, ever-resourceful Leo Valdez. Their allies? The
        shapeshifting Frank Zhang, the cursed but powerful Hazel Levesque, and the iron-willed Reyna Avila Ram√≠rez-Arellano, who
        proves that heroism doesn‚Äôt require a prophecy. And then there‚Äôs Nico di Angelo, the son of Hades who walks between life
        and death, haunted by ghosts‚Äîboth real and metaphorical. As they travel across the world, from the depths of Tartarus to
        the ruins of Greece, they battle monsters, giants, and even gods themselves. Friendships are tested. Love is found and
        lost. Sacrifices are made. And in the end, it all comes down to one final war against Gaea‚Äôs forces. Victory is
        uncertain. The price is steep. But these demigods were never destined for an easy fate. They were meant to change the
        world.And YOU will join them too.
